# Completed Projects: GAME

I have worked on many projects related to my major outside of class, but in my opinion, one of the most valuable projects I have done so far is the outcome of the Computer Science 309 class I’m taking this semester because of the number and scope of different skills I’ve acquired through its completion. While some of these newly acquired skills are technical--being related to knowledge and application of computer software--others are softer in nature, but both sets of skills are critical to my success as an engineer.

My project for Computer Science 309 was a game console built on the Raspberry Pi, a small computer with about the power of a smartphone. Because of the Pi’s limitations, the software I wrote for the Pi was written in C++, a language used by many large companies and organizations and designed for creating efficient computer programs. Because I had never successfully written programs in C++ before, creating and developing this project presented a myriad of challenges that led me to gain a basic understanding of many features of C++.

Another problem that I faced was that C++ code by itself cannot be understood by computers; it must be translated into a language that computers can understand. The process of translating C++ code is called compiling, and it is usually done by another program called a compiler. Different people and different computers can compile the same code in different ways. I’ve learned two common methods of compiling code into runnable programs: (1) by using tools in a program editor called Visual Studio and (2) by learning how to use a standalone program called Make. I chose to learn both because I worked in a team with three other people to develop this project.

Collaborating with others to write computer code can also be difficult because everyone must work on the latest version of that code and know how to contribute without negatively affecting others’ work. To minimize these issues, we learned a new tool called Git to create a repository for all the files that go into our project and to track issues that exist in our code.

By joining my team, not only did technical issues arise, but soft ones as well. It can be difficult to explain how and why to write a certain piece of code, so I have become more familiar with technical explanations. Also, I have never created a large project with strict deadlines, so through the deadlines of the class, I’ve gained the experience of working on projects under time pressure similar to those found in businesses.

In general, the environment for creating this project was much more similar to a business setting than that of most of my other projects: not only has it taught me how to make a computer program, but it also gave me the opportunity to learn how to collaborate with my peers to attain goals I could have never reached myself. I will be able to apply technical- and non-technical skills I gained through this project to efficiently and effectively write software in corporate settings.
