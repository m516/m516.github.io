<h2> 2019: 7-segment LED display driver for microcontrollers   </h2>
<p>
    This project was designed in the '10s for the '80s. 
</p>
<p>
  Four 4026 decade counters 
  drive the display modules. Their inputs were multiplexed, allowing 
  a microcontroller to display any four-digit number in milliseconds with 
  just four pins. 
</p>
<p>
  Everything is soldered together on a perf board and 
  an atrocious mix of lead-free and leaded solder.
</p>
<p>
  I would do so much differently next time, but perhaps my biggest mistake was
  placing components <i>before</i> worrying about their connections.
  It's a rat's next on the back!
