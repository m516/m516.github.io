<h2> 2023: Stable Diffusion-based Character Design</h2>
<p>
    There's a lot of hype around AI-generated art, and the debate on its use is ongoing. 
    As someone who can't draw to save my life, Stable Diffusion was a welcome addition to my 3D modelling 
    and shading workflow.
</p>
<p>
    This project was based on two reference photos generated by a variant of Stable Diffusion 1.4
    called <a href="https://huggingface.co/nitrosocke/mo-di-diffusion/tree/main">Mo-Di Diffusion</a>,
    trained to emulate the Modern Disney style more accurately than the stock model weights. Thank you
    <a href="https://huggingface.co/nitrosocke/">Nitrosocke</a> for the weights!
</p>
<p>
    I didn't spend too much time on texturing, shading, or grooming in hopes that I find time to complete the character
    some day. The textures were the reference images!
