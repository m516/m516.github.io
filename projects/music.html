<h2> 2020 </h2>
<p>
    These are my first attempts at electronic music design, following 
    my discovery of LMMS in early May (so don't expect greatness.) 
</p>
<p>
    Most instruments (including drums) are stock TripleOscillator presets
    or free MIDI soundfonts. The only custom audio effects were volume control.

<h2> 2021 </h2>
<p>
    I gave composition a break in 2021 until my internship. 
    This is when I discovered LMMS effects and instrument groups.
</p>
<p>
    For the first time, human vocal vibrato patterns are emulated 
    in leads by manually editing pitch automation in each note.

    Diversifying from house.

<h2> 2023 </h2>
<p>
    My most recent experiments
</p>
<p>
    Starting the transition from TripleOscillator and soundfonts to Zyn.
    LMMS doesn't support pitch automation with its native Zyn integration though, 
    so leads are still TripleOscillators.
